### Fashion Recommendation System
This project implements a multimodal fashion recommendation system that combines visual and textual data to provide relevant product suggestions.

-Key Features:
Multimodal Approach
Combines product images with their corresponding text descriptions to generate comprehensive embeddings for each item.

-Efficient Retrieval

1.Generates embeddings for all products and indexes them using FAISS.

2.Retrieves visually similar items through cosine similarity search.

3.Accepts user-uploaded images as queries to find matching products.

-Workflow:
Input Processing
User uploads an image of a fashion item.

Embedding Generation
Multimodal model processes both the query image and catalog (image + text) to create embeddings.

Similarity Search
FAISS retrieves nearest neighbors from indexed embeddings using cosine similarity.

Output
Displays top matching products from storage with their details.
